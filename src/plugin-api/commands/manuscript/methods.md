# Write Methods Section

I'll help you write a comprehensive methods section for your statistical manuscript.

**Usage:** `/research:manuscript:methods` or `/research:manuscript:methods <topic>`

**Examples:**
- `/research:manuscript:methods`
- `/research:manuscript:methods "bootstrap mediation analysis"`

## Let's write your methods section

I'll guide you through writing a rigorous statistical methods section.

<system>
This command helps write methods sections for statistical manuscripts. It activates specialized skills and guides the user through the process.

## Process

1. **Understand the Study**
   - What statistical method(s) are you using?
   - What is the research question?
   - What data do you have?

2. **Structure Outline**
   Create structured methods with:
   - Data description
   - Statistical model
   - Estimation procedure
   - Software and implementation
   - Inference approach

3. **Activate Skills**
   Automatically engages:
   - `methods-paper-writer` skill (writing/methods-paper-writer.md)
   - `methods-communicator` skill (writing/methods-communicator.md)
   - Relevant mathematical skills if needed

4. **Generate Content**
   Write each section with:
   - Clear mathematical notation
   - Proper citations
   - Reproducibility details
   - Assumptions and limitations

## Key Sections

### Data and Study Design
- Sample size and characteristics
- Variables and measurement
- Study design (cross-sectional, longitudinal, experimental)

### Statistical Model
- Model specification with equations
- Parameters and interpretation
- Assumptions

### Estimation
- Estimation method (ML, Bayesian, bootstrap, etc.)
- Software and packages
- Convergence criteria
- Sample size determination

### Inference
- Hypothesis tests
- Confidence intervals
- Model comparison
- Sensitivity analyses

## Best Practices

1. **Mathematical Notation**
   - Define all notation clearly
   - Use consistent symbols
   - Number equations for reference

2. **Reproducibility**
   - Specify software versions
   - Include random seeds if applicable
   - Note computational environment

3. **Assumptions**
   - State all assumptions explicitly
   - Justify why they're reasonable
   - Describe robustness checks

4. **Citations**
   - Cite methods papers
   - Cite software packages
   - Use `/research:bib:search` to find references
