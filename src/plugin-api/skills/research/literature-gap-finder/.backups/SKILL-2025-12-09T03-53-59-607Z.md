# Literature Gap Finder

**Systematic framework for identifying research opportunities in statistical methodology**

Use this skill when: positioning research contributions, finding gaps in methodology literature, identifying unexplored combinations of methods and settings, building literature reviews, or deciding on research directions.

## The Gap-Finding Framework

### What Makes a Good Research Gap?

A publishable gap must be:

1. **Real** - Not already addressed (check thoroughly!)
2. **Important** - Solves a problem researchers face
3. **Tractable** - Can be solved with available tools
4. **Novel** - Provides new insight, not just combination
5. **Timely** - Relevant to current research trends

### Types of Gaps

| Gap Type | Description | Example |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| **Method Gap** | No method exists for setting | No mediation analysis for network data |
| **Theory Gap** | Method exists but lacks theory | Bootstrap for mediation lacks consistency proof |
| **Efficiency Gap** | Methods exist but are inefficient | Doubly robust mediation more efficient |
| **Robustness Gap** | Methods fail under violations | Mediation under measurement error |
| **Computational Gap** | Existing methods don't scale | Mediation with high-dimensional confounders |
| **Extension Gap** | Existing method needs generalization | Binary → continuous mediator |

## Method × Setting Matrix

### The Core Framework

Systematically map methods against settings to find gaps:

```
                    METHODS
          │ Regression │ Weighting │ DR/TMLE │ ML-based │
──────────┼────────────┼───────────┼─────────┼──────────│
Binary A  │     ✓      │     ✓     │    ✓    │    ✓     │
Continuous│     ✓      │     ?     │    ✓    │    ?     │
SETTINGS  ├────────────┼───────────┼─────────┼──────────│
Time-vary │     ?      │     ✓     │    ✓    │    ✗     │
Clustered │     ✓      │     ?     │    ?    │    ✗     │
High-dim  │     ✗      │     ✗     │    ?    │    ✓     │

✓ = Well-developed    ? = Partial/emerging    ✗ = Gap
```

### Building Your Matrix

**Step 1: Identify Dimensions**

For mediation analysis:

| Dimension | Variations |
|-----------|------------|
| Treatment | Binary, continuous, multi-level, time-varying |
| Mediator | Single, multiple, high-dimensional, latent |
| Outcome | Continuous, binary, count, survival, longitudinal |
| Confounding | Measured, unmeasured, time-varying |
| Structure | Single mediator, parallel, sequential, moderated |
| Data | Cross-sectional, longitudinal, clustered, network |
| Assumptions | Standard, relaxed positivity, measurement error |

**Step 2: List Methods**

| Method Family | Specific Methods |
|---------------|------------------|
| Regression | Baron-Kenny, product of coefficients, difference |
| Weighting | IPW, MSM, sequential g-estimation |
| Doubly Robust | AIPW, TMLE, cross-fitted |
| Semiparametric | Influence function-based |
| Bayesian | MCMC, variational |
| Machine Learning | Causal forests, DML, neural |
| Bounds | Partial identification, sensitivity |

**Step 3: Fill and Analyze**

Mark each cell:
- ✓ (green): Well-established with theory + software
- ? (yellow): Emerging or partial coverage
- ✗ (red): Clear gap

### Example: Sequential Mediation Matrix

```
                         │ Product │ Weighting │ DR │ Bounds │
─────────────────────────┼─────────┼───────────┼────┼────────│
2 mediators, linear      │    ✓    │     ✓     │  ✓ │   ?    │
2 mediators, nonlinear   │    ?    │     ✓     │  ? │   ✗    │
3+ mediators, linear     │    ?    │     ?     │  ✗ │   ✗    │
3+ mediators, nonlinear  │    ✗    │     ?     │  ✗ │   ✗    │
With measurement error   │    ✗    │     ✗     │  ✗ │   ✗    │
With unmeasured conf.    │    ✗    │     ✗     │  ✗ │   ?    │
```

**Gaps identified**:
- DR methods for 3+ mediators
- Any method with measurement error
- Bounds approach underdeveloped

## Assumption Relaxation Trees

### The Framework

Map how assumptions have been relaxed over time:

```
                    Standard Mediation (Baron-Kenny 1986)
                              │
            ┌─────────────────┼─────────────────┐
            ↓                 ↓                 ↓
    No unmeasured      Linearity         No interaction
    confounding        assumed           assumed
            │                 │                 │
            ↓                 ↓                 ↓
    ┌───────┴───────┐   Nonparametric    VanderWeele
    ↓               ↓     (Imai 2010)    4-way decomp

    │               │               Multiple mediators?
    ↓               ↓               Longitudinal?
 E-value        Sharp bounds?       Measurement error?
(Ding 2016)         │                    │
    │               ↓                    ↓
    ↓           [YOUR GAP?]         [YOUR GAP?]
[YOUR GAP?]
```

### Building the Tree

**Step 1: Identify Original Assumptions**

For a classic method, list ALL assumptions:
1. Explicit assumptions (stated in paper)
2. Implicit assumptions (unstated but required)
3. Computational assumptions (required for implementation)

**Step 2: Trace Relaxation History**

For each assumption, find papers that:
- Relax it partially
- Relax it completely
- Replace it with different assumption
- Show consequences of violation

**Step 3: Find Unexplored Branches**

Look for:
- Combinations of relaxations not yet explored
- Relaxations in one method not applied to another
- Partial relaxations that could be completed

### Example: Positivity Assumption

```
Positivity: P(A=a|X) > ε > 0 for all a, x
                    │
    ┌───────────────┼───────────────┐
    ↓               ↓               ↓
Near-violation  Practical      Structural
                positivity      violations
    │               │               │
    ↓               ↓               ↓
Trimming      Overlap         Extrapolation
weights       assessment       methods
    │               │               │
    ↓               ↓               ↓
Truncation?   Diagnostics?   Bounds under
                             violations?
```

## Citation Network Analysis

### Forward and Backward Searching

**Backward**: From recent key paper, trace citations:
- What foundational papers are cited?
- What parallel developments exist?
- What's the intellectual lineage?

**Forward**: Using Google Scholar "Cited by":
- Who has built on this work?
- What extensions were made?
- What gaps remain unaddressed?

### Key Paper Identification

For any topic, identify:

| Category | Description | How to Find |
|----------|-------------|-------------|
| **Foundational** | Original method papers | Most-cited, oldest |
| **Textbook** | Comprehensive treatments | Citations across subfields |
| **Recent reviews** | State-of-the-art summaries | "Review" in title, last 5 years |
| **Frontier** | Latest developments | Top journals, last 2 years |
| **Your competition** | Groups working on same gap | Recent similar titles |

## Common Gap Patterns in Mediation

### Pattern 1: Data Structure Mismatch

**Gap template**: "[Method] assumes [simple structure], but in [application] data has [complex structure]"

Examples:
- Methods assume iid, but data is clustered
- Methods assume cross-sectional, but data is longitudinal
- Methods assume complete data, but missingness exists

### Pattern 2: Assumption Violation

**Gap template**: "[Method] requires [assumption], which is violated when [situation]"

Examples:
- Unmeasured mediator-outcome confounding
- Measurement error in mediator
- Treatment-mediator interaction

### Pattern 3: Estimand Ambiguity

**Gap template**: "When [complication], standard estimands [NDE/NIE] are not well-defined or interpretable"

Examples:
- Post-treatment confounding
- Time-varying treatments/mediators
- Multiple versions of treatment

### Pattern 4: Efficiency vs Robustness

**Gap template**: "Efficient methods require [strong assumptions], while robust methods are inefficient"

Examples:
- Doubly robust methods for mediation
- Semiparametric efficiency in complex settings
- Adaptive methods

### Pattern 5: Computational Barrier

**Gap template**: "Theoretically valid approach exists but [computational limitation]"

Examples:
- High-dimensional settings
- Continuous mediators requiring integration
- Bootstrap in complex models
