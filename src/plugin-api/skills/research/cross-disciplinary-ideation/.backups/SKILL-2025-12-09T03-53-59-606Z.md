## The Cross-Disciplinary Innovation Framework

### Why Cross-Disciplinary?

Many statistical breakthroughs originated elsewhere:

| Statistical Method | Origin Field | Transfer |
|-------------------|--------------|----------|
| MCMC | Physics (Metropolis) | Statistical computation |
| Boosting | Machine learning | Ensemble methods |
| Lasso | Signal processing | Sparse regression |
| Optimal transport | Mathematics | Distribution comparison |
| Neural networks | Neuroscience/CS | Flexible function estimation |
| Causal graphs | Philosophy/AI | Causal inference |

### The Innovation Cycle

```
Problem in Statistics → Abstract Structure → Search Other Fields
         ↑                                           ↓
    Validate/Adapt ←── Identify Analogues ←── Find Connections

## Structured Ideation Process

### Step 1: Problem Decomposition

Break the statistical problem into abstract components:

```
Problem: "Estimate mediation effects with measurement error"

Components:
1. Causal structure (DAG with mediator)
2. Latent variable (true M vs observed M*)
3. Identification (what assumptions needed?)
4. Estimation (how to account for error?)
5. Inference (variance under misspecification?)
```

### Step 2: Abstract Pattern Recognition

Identify the mathematical essence:

```
Abstract patterns in measurement error mediation:
- Signal + noise model
- Latent variable with proxy
- Product of uncertain quantities
- Attenuation toward null
```

### Step 3: Cross-Field Search

For each abstract pattern, search analogues:

| Pattern | Field to Search | Possible Analogues |
|---------|-----------------|-------------------|
| Signal + noise | Signal processing | Kalman filter, denoising |
| Latent variable | Factor analysis | EM algorithm, identifiability |
| Product of uncertainties | Physics | Error propagation, Heisenberg |
| Attenuation | Econometrics | Errors-in-variables, IV |

### Step 4: Deep Dive on Promising Connections

For each promising analogue:

1. **Understand the source method deeply**
   - What problem does it solve?
   - What assumptions does it make?
   - What are its limitations?

2. **Map to target domain**
   - What corresponds to what?
   - What assumptions translate?
   - What doesn't transfer?

3. **Identify the gap**
   - What modification is needed?
   - Is the gap a feature or bug?
   - Can we fill it?

### Step 5: Synthesis and Evaluation

```
Evaluation Criteria:
□ Does it solve a real problem?
□ Is it novel (not already done)?
□ Are assumptions reasonable?
□ Is it computationally feasible?
□ Can it be proven to work (theory)?
□ Does it work in practice (simulation)?
```
