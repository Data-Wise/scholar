# Method Transfer Engine

**Rigorous framework for adapting statistical methods across domains and settings**

Use this skill when: adapting a method from one field to another, extending a method to a new setting, formalizing an intuitive connection between methods, or verifying that a transferred method retains its properties.

## The Transfer Framework

### What is Method Transfer?

Taking a technique that works in Setting A and adapting it to work in Setting B, while:
- Preserving desirable theoretical properties
- Identifying what changes are needed
- Understanding what can and cannot transfer

### Transfer Quality Spectrum

```
Direct Application → Minor Adaptation → Major Modification → Inspired-By
      │                    │                   │                  │
   Same theory         Adjust for          Rewrite theory      New method,
   applies            new setting          for new setting     similar spirit
```

### Transfer Success Criteria

A successful transfer must:

1. **Solve the target problem** - Method actually helps in new setting
2. **Preserve key properties** - Consistency, efficiency, robustness transfer
3. **Have clear assumptions** - Know what's required in new setting
4. **Be verifiable** - Can prove/simulate that it works
5. **Add value** - Better than existing approaches

## Common Transfer Patterns

### Pattern 1: Estimator Family Transfer

**Template**: Estimator type from one setting to another

**Example**: IPW from survey sampling → causal inference

```
Source: Horvitz-Thompson estimator
        E[Y] ≈ Σᵢ Yᵢ/πᵢ where πᵢ = P(selected)

Target: IPW for ATE
        E[Y(1)] ≈ Σᵢ Yᵢ·Aᵢ/e(Xᵢ) where e(x) = P(A=1|X=x)

Mapping:
- Selection indicator → Treatment indicator
- Selection probability → Propensity score
- Survey weights → Inverse propensity weights

Key insight: Both correct for selection bias via reweighting
```

### Pattern 2: Robustness Property Transfer

**Template**: Robustness technique from one method to another

**Example**: Double robustness from missing data → causal inference

```
Source: Augmented IPW for missing data
        DR = IPW + Imputation - (IPW × Imputation)

Target: AIPW for causal effects
        Same structure but for counterfactual outcomes

Mapping:
- Missing indicator → Treatment indicator
- Missingness model → Propensity model
- Imputation model → Outcome model

Key insight: Product-form bias enables robustness to one misspecification
```

### Pattern 3: Asymptotic Result Transfer

**Template**: Asymptotic theory from simpler to complex setting

**Example**: Influence function theory → semiparametric mediation

```
Source: IF for smooth functional of CDF
        √n(T(Fₙ) - T(F)) → N(0, E[φ²])

Target: IF for mediation effect functional
        Requires: mediation-specific tangent space

Mapping:
- General functional → Mediation estimand
- CDF → Joint distribution (Y,M,A,X)
- Generic IF → Mediation-specific IF

Key insight: EIF theory applies to any pathwise differentiable functional
```

### Pattern 4: Identification Strategy Transfer

**Template**: Identification approach from one causal setting to another

**Example**: IV from economics → Mendelian randomization

```
Source: Instrumental variables for demand estimation
        Z → A → Y, Z ⫫ U

Target: MR for causal effects of exposures
        Gene → Biomarker → Outcome

Mapping:
- Price instrument → Genetic variant
- Demand → Exposure level
- Endogeneity → Confounding

Key insight: Exogenous variation strategy is general
```

### Pattern 5: Computational Method Transfer

**Template**: Algorithm from optimization → statistical estimation

**Example**: SGD from ML → online causal estimation

```
Source: Stochastic gradient descent for ERM
        θₜ₊₁ = θₜ - ηₜ∇L(θₜ; Xₜ)

Target: Online updating for streaming causal data
        Sequential estimation as data arrives

Mapping:
- Loss function → Estimating equation
- Gradient → Score contribution
- Learning rate → Weighting scheme

Key insight: Streaming updates possible for M-estimators
```

## Transfer Verification Checklist

### Theoretical Checks

- [ ] **Consistency maintained**: Proof carries over or new proof provided
- [ ] **Rate preserved**: Convergence rate same or characterized
- [ ] **Variance characterized**: Influence function derived if applicable
- [ ] **Efficiency understood**: Know if/when efficient

### Practical Checks

- [ ] **Computable**: Can actually implement the adapted method
- [ ] **Stable**: Numerical issues don't prevent use
- [ ] **Scalable**: Works at relevant data sizes

### Simulation Checks

- [ ] **Correct at truth**: Estimator unbiased when DGP matches assumptions
- [ ] **Proper coverage**: CIs achieve nominal coverage
- [ ] **Efficiency comparison**: Compared to alternatives
- [ ] **Robustness**: Behavior under assumption violations

### Documentation Checks

- [ ] **Assumptions clear**: All requirements stated
- [ ] **Limitations stated**: Known failure modes documented
- [ ] **Guidance provided**: When to use/not use

## Common Transfer Pitfalls

### Pitfall 1: Hidden Assumption Dependence

**Problem**: Source method relies on assumption not explicit in exposition

**Example**: Many ML methods implicitly assume iid data
- Transfer to clustered data fails silently
- Variance underestimated, inference invalid

**Prevention**:
- Read proofs, not just statements
- Check what each step requires
- Simulate under violations

### Pitfall 2: Changed Meaning

**Problem**: Same symbol/concept means different things

**Example**: "Independence" in different fields
- Statistical independence: P(A,B) = P(A)P(B)
- Causal independence: No causal pathway
- Conditional independence: Given covariates

**Prevention**:
- Define all terms explicitly
- Verify mathematical equivalence
- Don't assume same word = same concept

### Pitfall 3: Lost Efficiency

**Problem**: Method transfers but loses optimality properties

**Example**: MLE transferred to semiparametric setting
- Parametric MLE is efficient
- Plugging into semiparametric problem: no longer efficient
- Need to derive new efficient estimator

**Prevention**:
- Re-derive efficiency in target setting
- Don't assume optimality transfers
- Compare to efficiency bound

### Pitfall 4: Computational Invalidity

**Problem**: Algorithm doesn't work in new setting

**Example**: Newton-Raphson for optimization
- Works when Hessian well-behaved
- In ill-conditioned problems: numerical disaster

**Prevention**:
- Test on representative problems
- Check condition numbers, stability
- Have fallback algorithms

### Pitfall 5: False Generalization

**Problem**: Transfer works for one case, claimed general

**Example**: Method for binary → continuous
- Test case: continuous Y is approximately binary
- Claim: works for all continuous Y
- Reality: fails for skewed/heavy-tailed

**Prevention**:
- Test diverse scenarios
- Characterize where it works
- State limitations clearly

## Transfer Feasibility Assessment

### Quick Assessment Questions

| Question | If No | If Yes |
|----------|-------|--------|
| Same mathematical structure? | Major adaptation needed | Direct transfer possible |
| All assumptions translatable? | Some properties lost | Full transfer possible |
| Same data requirements? | Additional modeling needed | Straightforward application |
| Existing theory applicable? | New proofs required | Theory transfers |
| Similar computational structure? | Algorithm redesign | Code adaptation |

### Feasibility Score

For each dimension, score 1-5:

| Dimension | Score | Interpretation |
|-----------|-------|----------------|
| Structural similarity | __ /5 | 5 = identical structure |
| Assumption compatibility | __ /5 | 5 = all assumptions transfer |
| Theoretical portability | __ /5 | 5 = proofs carry over |
| Computational similarity | __ /5 | 5 = same algorithm works |
| Value added | __ /5 | 5 = major improvement |

**Total**: __/25

- 20-25: Strong transfer candidate
- 15-19: Feasible with moderate effort
- 10-14: Significant adaptation required
- <10: May need different approach
