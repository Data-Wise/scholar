# Identification Theory

**Comprehensive framework for causal identification in statistical methodology**

Use this skill when working on: causal identification, mediation analysis identification, DAG-based reasoning, potential outcomes, identification assumptions, partial identification, sensitivity analysis, or deriving identification formulas.

## Core Concepts

### What is Identification?

A causal parameter $\psi$ is **identified** if it can be uniquely determined from the observed data distribution $P(O)$.

Formally: $\psi$ is identified if $P_1(O) = P_2(O) \Rightarrow \psi_1 = \psi_2$.

### Why Identification Matters

```
Causal Question → Target Estimand → Identification → Estimation → Inference
     ↓                  ↓                ↓               ↓            ↓
  "Does A           E[Y(1)-Y(0)]     Express in      Statistical   Confidence
   cause Y?"                         terms of P(O)    methods      intervals
```

Without identification, no amount of data can answer causal questions.

## Two Frameworks

### 1. Potential Outcomes (Rubin/Neyman)

**Primitives**:
- $Y(a)$ = potential outcome under treatment $a$
- Only $Y = Y(A)$ is observed (consistency)
- Fundamental problem: never observe both $Y(0)$ and $Y(1)$ for same unit

**Advantages**:
- Clear definition of causal effects
- Natural for experimental reasoning
- Connects to missing data theory

### 2. Structural Causal Models (Pearl)

**Primitives**:
- Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) encoding causal structure
- Structural equations: $Y := f_Y(PA_Y, U_Y)$
- Interventions via do-operator: $P(Y | do(A=a))$

**Advantages**:
- Visual representation of assumptions
- Systematic identification algorithms
- Clear separation of statistical and causal assumptions

### Framework Equivalence

For most problems, both frameworks give equivalent results:
$$E[Y(a)] = E[Y | do(A=a)]$$

Choose based on context and audience.

## Key Identification Assumptions

### For Treatment Effects

| Assumption | Formal Statement | Interpretation |
|------------|------------------|----------------|
| **Consistency** | $Y = Y(A)$ | Observed outcome equals potential outcome for received treatment |
| **Positivity** | $P(A=a \mid X=x) > 0$ for all $x$ with $P(X=x) > 0$ | Every covariate stratum has both treated and untreated |
| **Exchangeability** | $Y(a) \perp\!\!\!\perp A \mid X$ | No unmeasured confounding given $X$ |
| **SUTVA** | No interference, single version of treatment | Units don't affect each other |

### For Mediation Effects

Additional assumptions required:

| Assumption | Formal Statement | Interpretation |
|------------|------------------|----------------|
| **Cross-world exchangeability** | $Y(a,m) \perp\!\!\!\perp M(a^*) \mid X$ | Counterfactual mediator independent of counterfactual outcome |
| **No $A$-$M$ interaction** (optional) | $Y(a,m) - Y(a',m)$ constant in $m$ | Simplifies identification |
| **Compositional** | $Y(a) = Y(a, M(a))$ | Potential outcome composition |

---

## Standard Identification Results

### 1. Average Treatment Effect (ATE)

**Target**: $\psi = E[Y(1) - Y(0)]$

**Under exchangeability** (A1), **consistency** (A2), **positivity** (A3):

$$\psi = E\left[E[Y | A=1, X] - E[Y | A=0, X]\right]$$

**Proof sketch**:
\begin{align}
E[Y(a)] &= E[E[Y(a) | X]] && \text{(iterated expectations)} \\
        &= E[E[Y(a) | A=a, X]] && \text{(A1: exchangeability)} \\
        &= E[E[Y | A=a, X]] && \text{(A2: consistency)}
\end{align}

### 2. Average Treatment Effect on Treated (ATT)

**Target**: $\psi_{ATT} = E[Y(1) - Y(0) | A=1]$

**Under weaker exchangeability** $Y(0) \perp\!\!\!\perp A \mid X$:

$$\psi_{ATT} = E\left[E[Y | A=1, X] - E[Y | A=0, X] \mid A=1\right]$$

### 3. Natural Direct and Indirect Effects (Mediation)

**Target**:
- NDE: $E[Y(1, M(0)) - Y(0, M(0))]$
- NIE: $E[Y(1, M(1)) - Y(1, M(0))]$

**Under mediation assumptions** (see VanderWeele, 2015):

$$NDE = \int\int \{E[Y|A=1,M=m,X=x] - E[Y|A=0,M=m,X=x]\} \, dP(m|A=0,X=x) \, dP(x)$$

$$NIE = \int\int E[Y|A=1,M=m,X=x] \{dP(m|A=1,X=x) - dP(m|A=0,X=x)\} \, dP(x)$$

### 4. Controlled Direct Effect (CDE)

**Target**: $CDE(m) = E[Y(1,m) - Y(0,m)]$

**Simpler identification** (no cross-world assumption):

$$CDE(m) = E[E[Y|A=1,M=m,X] - E[Y|A=0,M=m,X]]$$

---

## DAG-Based Identification

### The Back-Door Criterion

A set $X$ satisfies the back-door criterion relative to $(A, Y)$ if:
1. No node in $X$ is a descendant of $A$
2. $X$ blocks every path between $A$ and $Y$ that contains an arrow into $A$

**If satisfied**:
$$P(Y | do(A=a)) = \sum_x P(Y | A=a, X=x) P(X=x)$$

### The Front-Door Criterion

When there's an unmeasured confounder $U$ between $A$ and $Y$, but $M$ mediates all of $A$'s effect:

```
    U
   / \
  ↓   ↓
  A → M → Y
```

**Identification**:
$$P(Y | do(A=a)) = \sum_m P(M=m | A=a) \sum_{a'} P(Y | M=m, A=a') P(A=a')$$

### Instrumental Variables

When $Z$ affects $Y$ only through $A$:

```
  U
  ↓
Z → A → Y
```

**Local ATE identification** (with monotonicity):
$$LATE = \frac{E[Y | Z=1] - E[Y | Z=0]}{E[A | Z=1] - E[A | Z=0]}$$

---

## Sequential Identification (Multiple Mediators)

### Sequential Mediation (A → M1 → M2 → Y)

**Product of three path** identification requires:

1. Standard confounding control for each arrow
2. No intermediate confounders affected by treatment
3. Sequential ignorability assumptions

**Path-specific effects**:
- Direct: $A \to Y$
- Through $M_1$ only: $A \to M_1 \to Y$
- Through $M_2$ only: $A \to M_2 \to Y$
- Through both: $A \to M_1 \to M_2 \to Y$

### Identification Formula (No Intermediate Confounding)

$$\text{Effect through } M_1 \to M_2 = \int E\left[\frac{\partial^3}{\partial a \partial m_1 \partial m_2} E[Y|A,M_1,M_2,X]\right]$$

Expressed as product of coefficients: $\hat{\alpha}_1 \cdot \hat{\beta}_1 \cdot \hat{\gamma}_2$

---

## Partial Identification

When point identification fails, we can still bound the parameter.

### Manski Bounds (No Assumptions)

For ATE with missing outcomes:
$$E[Y(1)] \in [E[Y \cdot A]/P(A=1) + y_{min}P(A=0), E[Y \cdot A]/P(A=1) + y_{max}P(A=0)]$$

### Sensitivity Analysis

When exchangeability is uncertain, parameterize violation:

**Unmeasured confounding parameter** $\Gamma$:
$$\frac{1}{\Gamma} \leq \frac{P(A=1|X,U=1)/P(A=0|X,U=1)}{P(A=1|X,U=0)/P(A=0|X,U=0)} \leq \Gamma$$

Compute bounds as function of $\Gamma$ (Rosenbaum bounds).

### E-Value

Minimum strength of unmeasured confounding (on risk ratio scale) needed to explain away observed effect:

$$E\text{-value} = RR + \sqrt{RR \times (RR-1)}$$

---

## Identification Strategies by Design

### Randomized Controlled Trials (RCTs)

- Treatment assignment random → exchangeability holds by design
- Still need SUTVA, consistency
- For mediation: randomize $M$ as well, or use sequential ignorability

### Observational Studies

| Strategy | Key Assumption | Best For |
|----------|----------------|----------|
| Regression adjustment | All confounders measured | Rich covariate data |
| Propensity score | Correct PS model | High-dimensional confounders |
| Instrumental variables | Valid instrument exists | Unmeasured confounding |
| Regression discontinuity | Continuity at threshold | Sharp treatment rules |
| Difference-in-differences | Parallel trends | Panel data |

### Natural Experiments

- Exploit exogenous variation (policy changes, geographic variation)
- Requires careful argument for why variation is "as-if random"

## Identification in the MediationVerse

### medfit: Foundation
- Implements standard mediation identification
- VanderWeele regression-based approach
- Supports binary/continuous treatments and mediators

### probmed: Effect Size
- $P_M$ identification requires identified NDE/NIE
- Handles case when NDE and NIE have opposite signs

### RMediation: Confidence Intervals
- Takes identified effects as input
- Distribution of product of coefficients (PRODCLIN)
- Monte Carlo intervals

### medrobust: Sensitivity
- When identification assumptions are uncertain
- Bounds on effects under confounding
- E-values for unmeasured confounding

### medsim: Validation
- Simulate data where truth is known
- Verify identification formulas recover true effects
- Test estimator properties

## Identification Proof Template

```latex
\begin{theorem}[Identification of $\psi$]
Under Assumptions:
\begin{enumerate}[label=A\arabic*.]
\item (Consistency) $Y = Y(A)$, $M = M(A)$
\item (Positivity) $P(A=a|X) > \epsilon > 0$ for all $a \in \mathcal{A}$
\item (Exchangeability) $Y(a) \perp\!\!\!\perp A \mid X$
\end{enumerate}
the causal estimand $\psi = E[g(Y(a))]$ is identified by
\[
\psi = E_X\left[E[g(Y) \mid A=a, X]\right].
\]
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
\begin{align}
E[g(Y(a))] &= E\left[E[g(Y(a)) \mid X]\right]
    && \text{(law of total expectation)} \\
&= E\left[E[g(Y(a)) \mid A=a, X]\right]
    && \text{(by A3: exchangeability)} \\
&= E\left[E[g(Y) \mid A=a, X]\right]
    && \text{(by A1: consistency)}
\end{align}
The RHS depends only on the observed data distribution $P(Y,A,X)$.
\end{proof}
```

## Common Identification Pitfalls

### 1. Conditioning on Colliders

```
A → C ← Y
```

Conditioning on $C$ opens a path between $A$ and $Y$.

### 2. Conditioning on Mediators

```
A → M → Y
```

Conditioning on $M$ blocks the indirect effect, doesn't control confounding.

### 3. Overcontrol Bias

Conditioning on descendants of treatment can bias estimates.

### 4. M-Bias

```
U1 → X ← U2
↓         ↓
A ——————→ Y
```

Conditioning on $X$ opens path $A \leftarrow U_1 \rightarrow X \leftarrow U_2 \rightarrow Y$.

### 5. Table 2 Fallacy

Interpreting coefficients causally when model includes intermediate variables.

## Verification Questions

When reviewing identification arguments, ask:

1. **Is the target estimand clearly defined?**
2. **Are all assumptions explicitly stated?**
3. **Is each step in the derivation justified?**
4. **Are the assumptions plausible in this context?**
5. **What if an assumption is violated?**
6. **Is there a DAG that encodes the assumptions?**
7. **Are there alternative identification strategies?**
