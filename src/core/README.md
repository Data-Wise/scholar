# Core Business Logic

This directory will contain framework-agnostic business logic for scholar plugin functionality.

## Planned Structure

```
core/
├── literature/    # Literature search, metadata extraction
├── manuscript/    # Writing assistance, proof review
└── teaching/      # Course material generation
```

## Status

**Phase 2: Future Work**

This directory is currently a placeholder for the MCP Server Integration phase. Core logic will be extracted from commands and made framework-agnostic to support both Claude Plugin API and MCP Protocol.

See `README.md` Phase 2 roadmap for details.
